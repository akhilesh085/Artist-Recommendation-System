# Artist-Recommendation-System
## Spotify Exploratory Data Analysis  &amp; Artist Recommendation System

In this I have shown analysis of the attributes or features of songs.

##PROJECT STATEMENT:

This Integrated Project on Spotify Data Analysis Project will explain and show how to 
perform exploratory data analysis using Python on music-related datasets. Spotify is 
the world's largest audio streaming platform. It will explain and show how to analyze, 
visualize and draw insights with Python libraries and functions.
 
 
 TITLE OF THE PROJECT:
Spotify Data Analysis Project - Spotify Data Analysis Using Python
 
OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR EXECUTION:
The technology stack used for implementing this product is: BACK END: Excel, jupyter notebook.

ADVANTAGES:

• The exploratory data analysis of the Spotify dataset provides us with keen insights 
about music and the different effects of the different kinds of properties of music, this 
is an advantage in terms of insight and understanding that one gets that cannot be 
ascertained without doing analysis.

• Our project has the advantage of having the different kinds of attributes and their co-relation with each other, for example, the "popularity" metric of Spotify cannot be understood without an analysis of data related to popular music.

 OBJECTIVE AND KEY LEARNING:
This project takes a deeper dive into how music is evolved over the years. We 
are analyzing every feature that goes into making music and how they are 
correlated with each other and which attributes correlation lead to more 
popularity and acceptance in the bigger crowd. As we know Spotify is used all 
over the world and it creates a lot of data daily and it contains data from 
decades ago. So we can take a deeper dive into how music has evolved and 
what type of crowd it serves. So we analyze what gains the songs their 
popularity like what feature's corrections with others can make them more 
popular. What attributes were accepted in certain eras are now making a 
comeback.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT AND PROJECT OVERVIEW:

Being a universal music player, Spotify offers a wide array of selected music 
to the users its interface is quite simple and has a very comfortable mode of 
selection based on songs that can be recent, or most listened to by the user, or 
a confined playlist according to song preference and much more. This was the 
primary reason for using Spotify for this project and a second reason was it is 
available on all devices unlike some selective music players such as Apple 
music which gives privileges to only IOS users and apart from this Spotify has 
a wide range of data set making this project more full of data. impact of Spotify
with streaming and Spotify soaring in popularity, the record industry has seen 
revenues increase every year from 2015 to 2020. the growth was enough for 
fortune to proclaim in 2019 that Spotify saved the music industry. Spotify not 
only reduces deadweight loss; it also increases consumer welfare by reducing 
search costs. Spotify has revolutionized how we consume from mood playlists 
to machine algorithms, the streaming service has become the definitive 
tastemaker. Spotify encourages us to engage with it this way because we want 
to consume music more than ever for moods for special occasions soundtracks 
for activities and more.
 
METHODS AND DESIGN APPROACH: 

Build an ML model — To Predict the popularity of any song by analyzing various 
metrics in the dataset. This Prediction helps any content creator/musician to 
understand what Spotify listeners prefer to hear more nowadays which is key to
competing in the market to attain the Objective it's important to start by doing 
Exploratory Analysis and achieve a few insights from data. Find out which features 
are highly correlated with the Popularity attribute. 
The next step is to test different model algorithms and pick 
the best model based on key evaluation metric (R2 Score) 
2. Build a content-based 
Recommendation system that can suggest artists for any user.
This helps users to listen to songs based on their music preferences.
As you can see above, year, danceability, energy, loudness and tempo are important features for predicting popularity.

1) Speechiness and Danceability are highly related

2) Loudness and energy are highly correlated. This makes some sense as energy is definitely influenced by the volume the music is being played at.

3) Acousticness is highly negatively correlated with energy, loudness, and year.

4) Valence and danceability are highly correlated. Dance songs are usually happier and in a major key

Thus, from this data, it would be better for an artist to create a high-energy song 
with either electric instruments or electronic songs to have the best chance of generating the most popularity.
 
As we have noted throughout this project is that popularity is heavily dependent on 
the timeframe. As we see, Dakiti has the highest popularity rating by this graph but 
was released on October 30th, 2020. Using this data in our regression will give us a 
snapshot as to the attributes popular songs have for mid-2020, but may not work or 
become less relevant once we get further from this date.

Most Popular artist from 1921-2020 – Beatles

Visualize the popularity of The Beatles’ songs over the year


- Acousticness and instrumentaliness decreases from time to time (lowest in 2020)
- Danceability, Energy, Explicit, Loudness, and Tempo increase through time
- Speechiness stays within 0.1 to 0.2 after 1960
- 2103 songs are released in the year 2018
- From the dataset creator's own comments, it's likely these are 2000 most 
 popular songs from each selected year.
 
All the above graphs show keys influence a song. 
 
1) Like how which key leads to a song being more popular than others.
2) Which key has more frequency that leads to the song being more likable by 
the majority of the people.
 
Features used in the different genres: notice how acousticness is low in every 
genre. 

Conclusions: 

• The objective was to predict the popularity of any song and build a recommendation system 
to recommend songs 
• Performed Exploratory data analysis to derive insights from the data 
• Mostly 2000 popular songs are identified and added every year on Spotify 
• The most popular Artist from 1921 to 2020 is the Beatles
• The data was split into — train (80%) and test datasets (20%) for model building and evaluation respectively

Future Scope:
We are trying to build a Recommendation Engine that can either recommend 
similar artists or recommend songs in the future for any given user, as there is no 
user-related data available here but we can insert the data randomly to test out the algorithm.
We wish to use alternative ML Models so that we can improve the accuracy of the 
predictions of the project.
